Enterotool: A script to process sequencing data for enterovirus analysis.
========================================================

This script performs the following steps:
1. Trimming and cleaning of raw sequencing reads (FASTQ files).
2. Merging paired-end reads.
3. Filtering and removing chimeric reads.
4. BLAST analysis against a specified database.
5. Normalization of abundance data to Counts Per Million (CPM).
6. Visualization of genus-level relative abundances as a bar graph.

Usage:
------
./enterotool.sh <sample_name> <input_R1.fastq> <input_R2.fastq> <blast_database>

Arguments:
----------
<sample_name>         Name of the sample being processed. Used to name output files and directories.
<input_R1.fastq>      Path to the raw FASTQ file for the forward reads (R1).
<input_R2.fastq>      Path to the raw FASTQ file for the reverse reads (R2).
<blast_database>      Path to the BLAST database (e.g., Database/Enterovirus_data_clean).

Output:
-------
The script generates the following Directory Structure:

Enterotool-<sample_name>/
├── 00.Rawdata/          # Contains the original FASTQ files
├── 01.stats/            # Contains statistics before and after trimming
├── 02.results/          # Contains final results, including normalized abundance table and graph

Dependencies:
-------------
1. Conda environment with the following installed:
   - seqkit
   - trimmomatic
   - vsearch
   - blast
   - python3 (with pandas and matplotlib libraries)
2. A BLAST database prepared using 'makeblastdb'.

Example:
--------
./enterotool.sh Sample1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq /path/to/sample_R2.fastq /path/to/database.fasta

This will create the output directory 'Enterotool-Sample1' containing the processed results.

Notes:
------
- Ensure the database is formatted using 'makeblastdb' before running the script.
- Use the provided installer script to set up the required dependencies, or just make sure you have all of them install corectly. 
- The script automatically normalizes the abundance data to CPM and generates a genus-level bar chart, but you can choose to use it or not.
